       "  'Since 1872, New York’s Lotos Club, a literature and arts organization founded in 1870 that occupies a townhouse on East 66th Street, has regularly held banquets to honor notables in the arts, government, science, entertainment, sports and the business world. Well-known people tried pulling strings to be the featured guest. The dinners also include elaborate menus, sometimes featuring the art of the honoree. It’s all documented in “Art at the Table,” a lavish new book that describes around 120 of the 439 dinners that have been held through 2019. In the first 50 or so years, oysters, green turtle soup, fillet of beef and an ice cream dessert dominated the menus. Back in 1874, King Kalakaua of Hawaii was the celebrity guest, but no women were honored until 1922, when the opera singer Mary Garden was selected. (Women could not join the club until 1977.) The authors have threaded anecdotes throughout, like Mark Twain’s nap during his 12-course meal, a special Peruvian menu served for Mario Vargas Llosa and the menu printed on a Beethoven score for Richard Arnold, a violinist. The name of the club was taken from “The Lotos-Eaters” by Alfred Tennyson.',\n",

Corey Hammond, who works in e-commerce and consulting, moved to Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, four years ago and missed having a convenient butcher. Then, as restaurants like Faun, Oxalis and Olmsted began opening in the neighborhood, he thought a local butcher might be welcome. He connected with Greg Brockman, who left Forager’s Market in Dumbo. In May, they opened a weekend pop-up butcher in the kitchen of Faun, and its success justified their idea. Now, they have opened their own butcher selling nose-to-tail meats from a number of local farms, 32 to 230 miles away as listed on their website. “We couldn’t have gotten started without the pandemic,” Mr. Hammond said. “The restaurant kitchen wouldn’t have been available for our pop-up.” The shop is worker-owned. “I wanted the people who helped to build this business to get something out of it,” Mr. Brockman said. “The food business is really difficult, and this way we can pay a decent wage and know the workers would be more dedicated.” There are three other people involved in the shop. In addition to a variety of cuts of meat and poultry, the shop will offer rotisserie chickens, charcuterie, condiments and seasonings, and sandwiches.
